This is a supposed to be simple site, a simple presence for me on the web.  
I needed a tool that makes things simple.  
While going through the portfolio of few of my seniors, I came across [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).  

Having mostly used Python & Flask for such purposes before, I needed something as simple but didn't want to pull out a Swiss knife for buttering bread.
Hugo seemed to fit the bill perfectly.

The setup was quick & was easy.  
The site was up & running in no time.
