The 2016 edition of COFAS, the biennial international computer olympiad organised by City Montessori School, Lucknow was held in the month of November.  

There were teams from several countries participating in a pleathora of competitions.  
Five of us represented Loyola School Jamshedpur in various events.  

I was part of the Computer Quiz and the Game Design Challenge.  

[Anubhav Kumar Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anubhavkumar11/) and I won the quiz in a dominating fashion.  

We stood 2nd in the Game Design Challenge where we created a gamified science learning platform.  

Most of the good work for designing the game was done by my genius friend [Aakash Pahwa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aakash10399/).
