Hi, I am Praneet Shekhar.  
I am from Jamshedpur - The Steel City of India. Also known as Tatanagar, after the Tatas who set up this city.    
I did my schooling from [Loyola School, Jamshedpur](http://www.loyolajsr.com) and my engineering in Information Technology from [Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar](http://www.kiit.ac.in).  
Currently based out of Mumbai, I work for Oracle Financial Services.  
My primary area of focus is data engineering.

I am passionate about all things technology, especially the business of it.  
Apart from school curiculum, where we were introduced to programming with LOGO & GW-BASIC in early classes, I started teaching myself coding in 6th grade when I discovered web development through my sister's books who was studying computer engineering at the time.  
I was hooked.  
I spent hours on end tweaking CSS properties and playing with jQuery. I soon taught myself the basics of PHP and built my first website, it was a static music library with an integrated music player.  

Later I learnt Java at school through several amazing teachers and started exploring by myself further.  

I taught myself Python during university and built several small projects for myself.  You may view some of them [here](https://www.github.com/praneetshekhar).  

I am well versed in Python, SQL & Shell scripting and web development using Flask.  


I am an avid quizzer with over 13 years of quizzing under my belt, winning several quizzes across multiple genres at city/regional, zonal, national & international levels. You may read about some of these on this blog.  

I have also put my entrepreneurial instincts to work and tried my hand at building a company. I tried building a research firm which provided quizzing & knowledge solutions. The plan was to leverage the research and create a knowledge base for an AI to be able to suggest solutions to real world problems and to eventually be capable of contributing to the research.
The plan needs a lot of refining and I would love to work further on it. Reach out to me if you have any ideas regarding this or anything else we can work off of.
