      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am Praneet Shekhar.&lt;br&gt;
I am from Jamshedpur - The Steel City of India. Also known as Tatanagar, after the Tatas who set up this city. &lt;br&gt;
I did my schooling from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.loyolajsr.com&#34;&gt;Loyola School, Jamshedpur&lt;/a&gt; and my engineering in Information Technology from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kiit.ac.in&#34;&gt;Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Currently based out of Mumbai, I work for Oracle Financial Services.&lt;br&gt;
My primary area of focus is data engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am passionate about all things technology, especially the business of it.&lt;br&gt;
Apart from school curiculum, where we were introduced to programming with LOGO &amp;amp; GW-BASIC in early classes, I started teaching myself coding in 6th grade when I discovered web development through my sister&amp;rsquo;s books who was studying computer engineering at the time.&lt;br&gt;
I was hooked.&lt;br&gt;
I spent hours on end tweaking CSS properties and playing with jQuery. I soon taught myself the basics of PHP and built my first website, it was a static music library with an integrated music player.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
