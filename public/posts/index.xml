      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a supposed to be simple site, a simple presence for me on the web.&lt;br&gt;
I needed a tool that makes things simple.&lt;br&gt;
While going through the portfolio of few of my seniors, I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having mostly used Python &amp;amp; Flask for such purposes before, I needed something as simple but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to pull out a Swiss knife for buttering bread.
Hugo seemed to fit the bill perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Kolkata edition of TCS IT Wiz 2016 was held on the 31st of August.&lt;br&gt;
It is a highly anticipated quiz and a marquee event in the quizzing calendar, being the biggest inter-school IT quiz.&lt;br&gt;
Our school has a rich history in this quiz, with our seniors winning several editions.&lt;br&gt;
So the pressure was immense, especially coming up against the reigning National Champions, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/adnan-azmat-496000153/&#34;&gt;Adnan Azmat&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/shadankalam/&#34;&gt;Shadan Kalam&lt;/a&gt;, two incredibly knowledgeable and exceptional quizzers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
