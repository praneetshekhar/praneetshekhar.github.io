<meta name="description" content="Hi, I am Praneet Shekhar.
I am from Jamshedpur - The Steel City of India. Also known as Tatanagar, after the Tatas who set up this city. 
I did my schooling from Loyola School, Jamshedpur and my engineering in Information Technology from Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar.
Currently based out of Mumbai, I work for Oracle Financial Services.
My primary area of focus is data engineering.
I am passionate about all things technology, especially the business of it.
Apart from school curiculum, where we were introduced to programming with LOGO &amp; GW-BASIC in early classes, I started teaching myself coding in 6th grade when I discovered web development through my sister&rsquo;s books who was studying computer engineering at the time.
I was hooked.
I spent hours on end tweaking CSS properties and playing with jQuery. I soon taught myself the basics of PHP and built my first website, it was a static music library with an integrated music player.">
